        <h2>Advertising with [Alternate Route]: <br />A Statistical Sample</h2>
		<div class="review">
			<p class="indent full justify">
				We have an active community of readers, writers, that would love to look at your ad(s) and learn about your business.
				Know what I mean? We receive ~60 users/week and are at ~600 events, with an average engagement time of over 1m20s.
				Our homepage has received nearly 150 views within the last week (primarily from the U.S.--we could be doing
				more to spur international outreach). Just while writing this pitch, our website received a visitor.
				Our user stickiness, a measure of engagement, is in the 20%'s over the course of weeks to months, trailing.
				Nearly every page in our site's directory tree has received at least one to a few visitors historically,
				showing that our content is well-versed and keeps the needs of our audience in mind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent full justify">
				If you are a community-oriented organization, a literary-arts-focused organization owner, or just a wealthy
				Stark-like, do consider advertising with us to increase your numbers. We can be contacted at
				&lt;editor at alternateroute dot org&gt; to discuss opportunities.
			</p>
			<p class="indent full justify">
				Finally, if you are published in [Alternate Route] or enjoy our work, it would mean the world to us
				if you could spread the word. Thank you.
			</p>
