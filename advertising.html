        <h2>Advertising with [Alternate Route]: A Statistical Sample</h2>
        <p class="justify">
			We have an active community of readers, writers, that would love to look at your ad(s) and learn about your business.
			Know what I mean?<br />
			<br />
			We receive ~60 users/week and are at ~600 events, with an average engagement time of over 1m20s.
			Our homepage has received nearly 150 views within the last week (primarily from the U.S.--we could be doing
			more to spur international outreach). Just while writing this pitch, our website received a visitor.
			Our user stickiness, a measure of engagement, is in the 20%'s long-term and closer to 40% more recently.
			Nearly every page in our site's directory tree has received at least one to a few visitors historically,
			showing that our content is well-versed and keeps the needs of our audience in mind.
        </p>
		<p class="justify">
			If you are a community-oriented organization, a literary-arts-focused organization owner, or just a wealthy
			Stark-like, do consider advertising with us to increase your numbers. We offer competitive bidding in a
			calendar-based sign-up system open to the public. The link to your solution can be found
			<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=YmFkMjViN2YxYTMyNGY4M2I1ODkxNjg1YTlhMzZkNjI4NjA4NDdhODdmOTdhMDU2N2JmYzRjYjRmNDdlNTA1MkBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t">
				here</a>.

		<p class="justify">
			Finally, if you are published in [Alternate Route] or enjoy our work, it would mean the world to us
			if you could spread the word. Thank you.
