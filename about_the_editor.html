        <h1 id="title">Greetings!<br />
          &<br />
          About the Editor</h1>
        <p>
            Hello and thank you for visiting our magazine. I say "our" even though as of now (13Nov2021), the staff includes 1 person: me, Michael O. Starr. So, because quality lit mags and zines usually require
            some transparency about the editorial staff, here's a little about myself:
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated with an Bachelor's in Science in Biology from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2010. I went on to study Biomedical Engineering, the PhD program, at
            <a href="https://bme.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a>. Ironically, as of this date, the topic on the department's homepage is a $1.9 million grant awarded on the subject I wished to study for my thesis,
            albeit to a different professor. In any case, I had to drop out with "just" (I know, wow) a Master's in 2013 due to health issues. It took me a while to recover and I did some stints for a number
            of years in big pharma to make the big bucks (not really, they don't pay the underlings all that much).
        </p>
        <p>
            That is all and well, but what about poetry, creative writing, and art? Not to worry: I've been unprofessionally trained (the best kind of training available) since approx. 2004 in photography and poetry,
            among other things acting as the editor-in-chief for my high school's literary magazine my Junior and Senior years. I doubt you'll find us on the web, but the name of the zine was Catharsis. Maybe
            you'll find an ultra-rare copy someday :). Or maybe they're <a href="mailto:catharsis.mv@gmail.com">still running print?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been writing poetry on-and-off since then. Yes, that's about 18 years. So I have experience in the field. Although I didn't engage in the competitive publishing scene until recently, just a few
            years ago (which I have to admit, I don't all to much like and have many gripes with--the irony, I know), I thought it would be awesome to contribute in the sense of publishing those of quality who
            would likely be rejected by the ultra-picky editorial staff of your reg'lar zine out there for no good reason other than they have a quota that they fill up and then basically shit be told to
            anyone else they recieve. That's my take on it, anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            So here we are, publishing your work. I have to say, we've received a ton of quality stuff since we've started, something I wasn't in all honesty expecting. Thank you for taking us seriously and
            giving us the respect I dare say we hardly deserve as new kids on the block. Perhaps it's a mirror of how seriously I take it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shout out to CJ Delious (sp?), RedBear, BrokenMaya, and DrunkLotus for getting this project off the ground. We started off as more of a poetry troupe, and the project evolved into what it is now.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yes, that's me in the first two issues. Published in my own zine. I do admit that is wholly unprofessioal, and I apologize, but we were, as I say, a troupe at the start, and I wasn't sure what
            rules applied, in all traditional senses, at that time. Now I know, and I swear on my heart I won't publish myself in any future issues. You hear me, <a href="https://www.newpages.com/">NewPages</a>?
            I'm following the rules. Include us in your database! Wahhhh! &gt;_&lt;.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you again for visiting. I hope you enjoy our zine and its contents. Please do Google our authors, I know that most introductory writers and artists are just starving for a little fame.
            (I hope that statement is not too pejorative, y'all.) And do feel free, if you have any questions or comments, gripes or groans, to contact myself (and any of our future editorial staff, if we
            ever acquire any) at <a href="mailto:mike@alternateroute.org">mike [at] alternateroute [dot] org</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/alternateroute">@alternateroute</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, please do consider becoming a patron of the arts by signing up for small, regular donations to our cause at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/alternate_route">patreon [dot] com [slash] alternate_route</a>.
            (Don't worry too much about the 18+ warning; it's only for a few rare pieces in a couple of our zine issues, and not at all indicative of the overarching feel or mood of the periodical).
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you. We don't have any plucky one-liners or signing off sayings, so, I guess, just, stay well, be happy, and do your best.<br />
            Cheers, Mike
        </p>
