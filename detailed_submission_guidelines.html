        <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <ul class="sub_guidelines">
            <li>
                Poetry Submission: Please send up to three pages of poetry. This may be a combination of short poems, or one or two longer poems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prose Submission: Please send up to 2,000 words of prose. We accept creative nonfiction as well as fiction.
            </li>
            <li>
                Art Submission: Please send up to three pieces of art.
            </li>
			<li>
				Submission format: [AR] uses OpenOffice Writer to edit files and build the journal. Its native filetype is .odt; it can read .doc(x)
				files but there may be a rare formatting change in the conversion. This is to say, we don't necessitate a certain filetype
				or types for the submission, but we hope this informs your formatting decisions for your piece(s).
				Lastly, if you feel like being nice to us, we end up converting all biographies to .txt files each titled "bio.txt" (they then
				go in their respective author/artist folders, which is how we identify them). What <i>isn't</i> compatible with our
				setup are PDF files. Lastly, art can be sent in whichever image format you like.
			<li>
				Author & [AR] Rights: We request worldwide bleh bleh bleh rights upon submission. In other words, once you submit to us, and it has been
				agreed upon that your work shall be published, if you request a rescindment, we will do our best to withdraw your work.
				However, pending (in)convenience, this may not always be possible. We hope you understand and don't find being a published
				poet too much of a burden for your ego.
			</li>
			<li>
				Third-person Biography: The--sorry, <em>a</em>--third person biography is totally up to you, but if you don't submit one, your bio spot on the website
				will be empty. If you wish to not have one, please delineate so in your submission email.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cover Letter(s): To be frank, we don't always... read?... your cover letters... in full. Having said that, we really appreciate them,
				and we appreciate when you understand that we understand that you understand that we all understand each other understandingly. (Viz. a cover letter is optional.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Submission Email: Submission email is &lt;editor [at] alternateroute [dot] org&gt;.
			</li>
			<li>
				Semi-quota System: We operate on a semi-quota system, so once we have received enough quality submissions we will once again shut our doors for the period. Thank you.
			</li>

			<li>Response Time: Expect a quick response time, but give us up to three months.</li>
			<li>Previously Published Work: We accept previously published work as long as we have the information and opportunity to acknowledge the prior publisher(s).</li>
			<li>Page Size: We use 5.5"x8"5" page size, so if your poems contain long lines on 8.5"x11.5" page size, they will definitely run over to the next
				line when displayed in our journal.
			</li>
			<li>Publication Errors: If you find a mistake in the publication after it has been released, feel free to bring it to our attention
				and we will do our best to correct it.
			</li>
			<li>
				Errata: I can't think of anything else right now. Just be nice. You know, like, David-Foster-Wallace nice.
			</li>
        </ul>
