        <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Poetry: Please send up to three pages of poetry. This may be a combination of short poems, or one or two longer poems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prose: Please send up to 2,000 words of prose. We accept creative nonfiction as well as fiction.
            </li>
            <li>
                Art: Please send up to three pieces of art.
            </li>
			<li>
				We request worldwide bleh bleh bleh rights upon submission. In other words, once you submit to us, and it has been
				agreed upon that your work shall be published, if you request a rescindment, we will do our best to withdraw your work.
				However, pending (in)convenience, this may not always be possible. We hope you understand and don't find being a published
				poet too much of a burden for your ego.
			</li>
			<li>
				The--sorry, <em>a</em>--third person biography is totally up to you, but if you don't submit one, your bio spot on the website
				will be empty. If you wish to not have one, please delineate so in your submission email.
			</li>
			<li>
				To be frank, we don't always... read?... your cover letters... in full. Having said that, we really appreciate them,
				and we appreciate when you understand that we understand that you understand that we all understand each other understandingly.
			</li>
			<li>
				You may submit to two (2) out of the three (3) categories (poetry, prose, art). Your choice.
			</li>
			<li>
				I can't think of anything else right now. Just be nice. You know, like, David Foster Wallace nice.
			</li>
			<li>
				Submiss-eeno emo-ru is &lt;editor [at] alternateroute [dot] org&gt;.
			</li>
			<li>
				We operate on a semi-quota system, so once we have received enough quality ( ;-) ) submissions we will once again shut our doors for the period. Thank you.
			</li>

			<li>Expect a quick response time, but give us up to three months.</li>
        </ul>
