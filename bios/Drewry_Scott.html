	  <h2>Drewry Scott</h2>
	  <p id="bio">
			I myself (he/him) am a resident of the Pacific Northwest, graduated from Evergreen State College in 2016 with an emphasis in creative writing and literature. With my writing I am hoping for connection and understanding with the world around me, as impossible a task as that may be sometimes. Other fiction work of mine has been published by The Writerâ€™s Foundry Review out of Brooklyn, NY, released June 2021.
