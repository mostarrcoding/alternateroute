        <p id="bio">
            Marnie Bullock Dresser lives in Spring Green, Wisconsin with her husband and son and four cats in a house that, really, isn't
big enough for that many living creatures. She has taught at the tiniest University of Wisconsin campus for the longest time.
Her work has appeared in many places, including Prairie Schooner, The Antioch Review, Sou'wester, The American Literary
Review, and CutBank.
