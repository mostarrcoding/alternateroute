        <h2>Mike Kaarsgaren</h2>
        <p id="bio">
            'In 2013 Mike Kaarsgaren graduated from the Economics, Law and management programme at Hogeschool Utrecht. In his spare moments, he dedicated his time writing poems, of which some of them have been published by local newspapers. Shortly after his graduation he enrolled into a job as a sales and customer success manager at a software company in Amsterdam, where his passion for communication and language further awakened.<br />

Inspired by the contemporary art scene he now sets his goal to liberate the poetry from conventional standards and formats that are defining the current market. His work is described as transgressive in nature and frequently includes visual and/or experimental constituents.
