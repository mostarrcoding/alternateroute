	  <h2>Kehinde Omotosho</h2>
	  <p id="bio">
			Kehinde Omotosho, a Nigerian-born identical twin, is an avid lover of art. As she likes to put it, she speaks art in accents of poetry, fiction, music, and humor amongst others. She relocated to the United States in 2015 and made a complete career swap from being a news anchor in Nigeria to studying Nursing. When not travelling  to her heartâ€™s content, she is either in the arms of her loving husband back home in Indianapolis, Indiana or cooking up a storm. <br />
