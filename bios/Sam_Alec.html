	  <h2>Sam Alec</h2>
	  <p id="bio">
			Sam Alec is a mostly unknown artist currently residing in the San Francisco Bay Area. Some impressive accomplishments include: successfully evading desensitization, a few major demolitions and reconstructions of personal belief systems, a well-cultivated affinity for the ugly and uncomfortable, a handful of lessons learned the hard way, and staying alive this long. Poems from Sam are published or forthcoming in Troublemaker Firestarter, Home Planet News, Big Q, and Hidden Peak Press.
