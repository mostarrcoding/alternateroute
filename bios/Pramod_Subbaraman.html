            Pramod Subbaraman is a Dentist and Poet from India who lives in Hull, England with his wife and son. He returned to poetry during the first UK wide COVID19 Lockdown in 2020, a time when thoughts about his own mortality were upmost in his mind and poetry seemed to be the best coping mechanism. His work has since been published in the UK and the USA. He tweets: @briteeth
