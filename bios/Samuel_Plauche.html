	  <h2>Samuel Plauche</h2>
	  <p id="bio">
			Samuel Plauche was born on the island of Vashon in Washington. With not much to do on the heavily forested island, Plauche quickly found a love in books, which quickly led to a love of storytelling as he would make up stories of magical creatures in the woods around his house.<br /><br />At the age of twelve, Plauche moved to southern Louisiana where he became more involved with his Cajun heritage and began hearing more and more Cajun folktales, songs, and poetry. These writing lessons only found on bayous and southern porches continued to influence Plauche's writing, and soon he too was joining these storytelling sessions with ones of his own creation.<br /><br />Eventually, Plauche moved to Seattle, and his writing changed yet again to include more stories about living in the city. Plauche now combines the magic found in forests and the themes of old Cajun storytelling into setting specific stories, often inspired by events from his own life, about the highs and lows of the cities he has been to. <br /><br />Plauche moved to Chicago and graduated from Columbia College Chicago with his Bachelor's Degree in Creative Writing with a specification in Fiction. He has recently had work published in Commuterlit, Black Poppy Review, and Mementos CHI as well as having an active website (https://www.samuelplauche.com/) where he self publishes poetry and short stories for his ever growing audience.
