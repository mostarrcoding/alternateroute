	  <p id="bio">
			Paul H. Lewellan lives and gardens in Davenport, Iowa, with his wife Pamela, his Shi Tzu Mannie, and their ginger tabby Sunny. He has recently published fiction in Miniskirt Magazine, Plateful of Pandemic, Talon Review, DASH Literary Journal, and CERASUS. Although he doesn't believe life begins at 70, it does get more interesting after then. @Paul_Lewellan (he/his/him)
