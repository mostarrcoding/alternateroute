	  <h2>Karine Leno Ancellin</h2>
	  <p id="bio">
			Karine Leno Ancellin was born and grew up in New York city until she moved first to Paris, then London, and further out to the Sahara region in West Africa, to Shanghai and Mumbai.... She worked on 'Kaleidoscopic identities of Muslim Characters' for her Phd at the Vrije Universiteit of Brussels. She was a journalist in West Africa for 10 years. Now as a professor of poetry, prose and drama, she constantly rereads the classics. She loves W.H. Auden, ee cummings and Hanna Arendt. She also translates and writes essays. Her first poetry collection The Missing Angle (2019) Riza Press addresses the fluidity in the architecture of contemporary emotions. As ways of being together have morphed, from the ancient Greeks to nowadays, Ancellin focuses on digitization of rapports with virtual media and its influence on personal relationships. In a growingly divided yet globalized world, she observes the prism of societal atomization on intimacy and personal feelings. <br /><br />https://karinelenoancellin.net
