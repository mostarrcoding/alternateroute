            RedBear has long been artistically drawn, mainly musically, but also with words. His poetry arose as an outlet of emotions arising from very desperate times. Barred from playing music because of illness and with so many obsessive thoughts going on in his head, he wanted some way to get them out. And lo and behold, those desperate thoughts resonated with other people. His deepest pain and fears resonated with people. In fact, the rawness of some of his blog post actually seemed to inspire some people. He was and still is amazed by that. RB's poetry tends towards topics of nature, love, askew nonsense, and struggles living in a complicated world.
