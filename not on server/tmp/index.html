<h1>[Alternate Route]</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the [Alternate Route] homepage.
[Alternate Route] is an independent literary magazine publishing online quarterly open to submissions year-round to writers globally.<br />
We publish January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31.
</p>

<br />

<p>
<h2>Submission Guidelines:</H2>
Email up to 5 pages of creative writing and/or art (poetry, prose, short stories, art, photography, etc.) to <b>alternateroute.zine [at] gmail [dot] com</b> with the following information included in the body of the email:
<ul>
<li>Your name as you would like it to appear in the zine</li>
<li>Your initials as you would like them to appear at the top of the pages on which your work appears in the zine</li>
<li>A 3rd person biography, short and sweet does it (typically includes previous published work, author geographical location, but may include whatever you choose about yourself)</li>
<li>Optionally, any other things you'd like us to hear (a "cover letter" if you will)</li>
</ul>
Writing in your pieces should be in standard font (something like Times New Roman or Garamond size 12).
Submit your pieces as separate individual attachments (one attachment per piece) with the title of the piece as the file name. If any pieces are meant to be coupled together, let us know and how you'd like them coupled (e.g. a diptych or triptych of photographs).<br />
Please title all your artwork.<br />
We do not yet offer financial compensation for accepted work, but are working on growing our readership and hope to have sufficient Patreon funds to be able to pay out in the future.<br />
We are listed on CLMP and soon hope to be listed on NewPages, and also have a Twitter (<b>@alternateroute</b>), so we do advocate for our artists. We have a staff of 1 but time permitted and quality of work pending, we may at our discretion submit content in our magazine for prizes and awards.<br />
Upon acceptance of your work to our zine via email response, we request exclusive electronic first worldwide serial rights. That means that you must not publish your work elsewhere until it appears online in our zine, after which rights are reverted to you and you can do whatever you want with your work.<br />
	We accept simultaneous submissions, but please let us know as soon as your work is accepted elsewhere if/when it is. Thank you.<br />
