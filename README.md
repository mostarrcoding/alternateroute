Literary magazine. Editor and founder.
This is a literary magazine for the outcast, those who travel the road less traveled by. Or so my sorry attempt at quoting Robert Frost, a famous British poet.
So, the website is simple. HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
Currently working on a quote generator for the bottom of the site to leave users refreshed and inspired when they leave instead of like that's the end and
nothing else will ever happen good again. Sorry broken English, scientific language goes.
